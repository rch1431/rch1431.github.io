    <h2>a rant about apple and audio formats (1/30/25)</h2>
    <br>
    <a href="/blog/"><- back</a>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This all started when I was downloading some free album off of bandcamp. It gave me the option of
                    which file
                    <br>
                    formats, so I chose flac, as it's pretty standard and high quality while not taking 700mb of disk
                    space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But then iTunes said "Nuh Uh!" (sorry, iTunes rolls of the tongue better. no way i'm calling it "tHe
                    APpLe
                    MuSiC
                    <br>
                    aPp). We want you using OUR proprietary (technically better with compression, but not accepted
                    anywhere else
                    OTHER
                    <br>
                    THAN iTUNES) audio format. Why? cuz we hate you, duh. <br>
                    <br>
                    First, I "googled" "flac to m4a", i scrolled past the the first 7 FLAC to M4A websites that showed
                    up and
                    <br>
                    clicked on some GitHub page to some python script that said it would do that. Problem, documentation
                    wasn't
                    very
                    <br>
                    clear so I did another search, this time on reddit. <br>
                    <br>
                    I read about a program called XDL, so i went and downloaded it. but the guy didnt pay apple tax so i
                    couldn't
                    <br>
                    run the app (i should also rant about about apple and their development stuff). Read even more and
                    found
                    <br>
                    something called MediaHuman audio converter, so I finally was able to convert my flac files to m4a
                    and put
                    them
                    <br>
                    in iTunes <br>
                    <br>
                    but then i realized something, im wearing wireless earbuds. Ok, their airpods, apple must have
                    something
                    that
                    <br>
                    allows me to play lossless on them. But no, They only have it for their $3500 waste of money called
                    apple
                    vision
                    <br>
                    pro. So i went through all that trouble for nothing, and realized that the stupid apple branded
                    things i
                    bought
                    <br>
                    for my apple branded device could not play lossless. <br>
                    <br>
                    fuck you apple. <br>
                    <br>
                    sincerely, ricky <br>
